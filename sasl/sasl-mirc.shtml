<p>The most recent solution for enabling SASL in mIRC appears to be with sasl.mrc, the first of the options documented below. Some older solutions have also been reported, with varying degrees of success. They are still listed here in case the first option does not work.</p>

<h2 id="saslmrc">Configuring SASL for mIRC: sasl.mrc</h2>
<p>The mirc script is written by Kyle Travaglini and was originally taken from a <a href="http://forum.swiftirc.net/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=23101">SwiftIRC forum post</a>. The SwiftIRC version has been replaced by a version that does not require the DLL. The instructions have been updated by KindOne.</p>

<!-- This website has died
<p>The steps for using sasl.mrc are <a href="http://www.zph.co.cc/mirc#TOC-Simple-Authentication-and-Security-Layer-SASL-">documented here</a>. A brief summary is also included below.</p>
-->

<ol>
	<li><p>Start mIRC and where you would type text to send to a channel, type<span class="verbatim-b">/run .</span> (slash RUN space period) and hit Enter. A folder will open. Take note of this location.</p></li>
	<li><p>Download <a href="sasl.mrc">sasl.mrc</a> and save it in the folder from above. You may need to right click and select <span class="verbatim-i">Save Link As...</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p>In mIRC, click <u>T</u>ools then Sc<u>r</u>ipts Editor.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click on the Remotes tab, then on <u>F</u>ile and <u>L</u>oad. Find and load sasl.mrc.<br />
		<img src="sasl-mirc-1.png" alt="mIRC: scripts editor remotes" height=73 width=334 /></p>
		<p>Alternatively, you could use the <span class="verbatim-i">/load</span> command.</p></li>
	<li><p>You will see a warning like the one below. You will need to click <u>Y</u>es to finish loading the SASL script.<br />
		<img src="sasl-mirc-2.png" alt="mIRC: script load warning" height=183 width=324 /></p></li>
	<li><p>Go back to the main mIRC window, and click Commands, then mSASL v1.0 Beta [sans DLL].<br />
		<img src="sasl-mirc-3.png" alt="mIRC: Commands menu" height=50 width=335 /></p></li>
	<li><p>Either select the entry for freenode or click Add. (See below.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Fill in Network (if applicable). This must exactly match the network in the server list.</p></li>
	<li><p>In Username, enter your registered nickname. Enter your NickServ password in the NS Password field. Domain should be <span class="verbatim-i">0</span>, and AuthType should be <span class="verbatim-i">PLAIN</span>.<br />
		<img src="sasl-mirc-4.png" alt="mIRC: SASL Manager + Network Configuration" height=331 width=644 /></p></li>
	<li><p>Click OK twice to close the dialog boxes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If everything has been configured correctly, the next time you connect you should see the message: <span class="verbatim-b">SASL authentication successful</span></p>
<p>The server address when you connect must match the server address in the server list. You can check this by typing alt+e, finding the <span class="freenode">freenode</span> folder, expanding and clicking a server, then clicking Edit. If you don't use the server listed here, the script won't work.</p>
<p>If NickServ is unavailable when you connect, then the script will fail and loop repeatedly trying to connect repeatedly until NickServ is back.</p>
<p>Remember to update your settings if you change your NickServ account name or password.</p>
<p>Your nick and password are stored in a plain text file, <span class="verbatim-i">sasl.hsh</span>, in the same folder as the script.</p>

<h2 id="saslmrclite">Configuring SASL for mIRC: sasl-lite.mrc</h2>
<p>The &quot;lite&quot; script was taken from a <a href="http://forums.mIRC.com/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=228222">mIRC forum post</a>, which took it from a now-expired pastebin. It lacks the configuration dialog that sasl.mrc has.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Download <a href="sasl-lite.mrc">sasl-lite.mrc</a> and save it in the mIRC application data folder, probably C:\Users\<i>USERNAME</i>\AppData\Roaming\mIRC.</p></li>
	<li><p>Open the file in your editor and replace
		<span class="verbatim-b">var %user = ENTER YOUR USERNAME HERE</span>
		with your registered nickname. Then replace
		<span class="verbatim-b">var %password = ENTER YOUR PASSWORD HERE</span>
		with your NickServ password.</p></li>
	<li><p>Load sasl-lite.mrc using the <span class="verbatim-i">/load</span> command.</p></li>
	<li><p>If everything has been configured correctly, the next time you connect you should see the message:</p>
		<span class="verbatim-b">SASL authentication successful</span></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="oldsaslmrc">Configuring SASL for mIRC: the original sasl.mrc and SASL.dll</h2>
<p>This version of the sasl.mrc script is the original, taken from the <a href="http://forum.swiftirc.net/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=23101">SwiftIRC forum post</a>. It needs a DLL in addition to the script file.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Download <a href="sasl-old.mrc">sasl-old.mrc</a> and save it as sasl.mrc in the mIRC application data folder, probably C:\Users\<i>USERNAME</i>\AppData\Roaming\mIRC.</p></li>
	<li><p>Download <a href="SASL.dll">SASL.dll</a> and save it in the same place. The <a href="sasl-mirc.cpp">source code for the DLL</a> is available as well. It was compiled with Visual Studio 2008 on Windows 7.</p></li>
	<li><p>Load the script, and press F2 to open the configuration.</p></li>
	<li><p>Fill in the required fields. Make sure to enter your nickname.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click OK. You may need to click Save.</p></li>
	<li><p>If everything has been configured correctly, the next time you connect you should see the message:</p>
		<span class="verbatim-b">SASL authentication successful</span></li>
</ol>
